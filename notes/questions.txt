(* Checkpoint 1 Questions *)
-How do we make two mains (client/server)? Can we have types at the root directory and then share them between the client/server directories?
-Ideas for testing sending to sockets? Should we come up with some mock clients?
-Should the client be tested with mock connections as well?
-Are we using the MonadSocket in the right way (esp. in the type constraint for functions?)
-Should the ServerState be a state monad? How would that look? What are the trade offs?
